General
q = quit
p = pause

Advanced tweaking (Not recommended)
r = increase delay between audio frames (increases accuracy but slower)
f = decrease delay between audio frames (decreases accuracy but faster)
d - toggle to interpolate bars (Smooths out the bars, but adds "visual" delay)

Bar Visuals
t = lower ceiling (bars react more, like raising the volume)
g = raise ceiling (bars react less, like lowering the volume)
y = decrease bar thickness
u = increase bar thickness
h = decrease gap thickness
j = increase gap thickness

Debug
n = show audio frames amount
b = show bars amount
v = show audio delay
c = show ceiling number
x = show FPS
