ReVidia [Native Linux]

Installation
============================

ReVidia on Linux REQUIRES Python 3.7+ and Portaudio

If you don't have PortAudio download and compile it from:
http://www.portaudio.com/download.html
Or better yet, use your package manager.

To install, from the project dir run:
chmod +x install.sh && ./install.sh 

After it says "Done" you can exit your terminal.
Then just use the desktop shortcut to enjoy!

Note: Run the installer again if you move the file at all


Usage/About
============================

General:

- This software ONLY accepts input(mics) audio streams for now.

- To use your speaker's audio I recommend using jack like in this guide:
  https://forum.manjaro.org/t/how-to-replace-pulseaudio-with-jack-jack-and-pulseaudio-together-as-friend/2086
  
  Or something like this: https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/82259/how-to-pipe-audio-output-to-mic-input#
  
- The FPS combo box is the global timer. So if you set it higher, everything will run faster and vice versa.

- The icon is just my profile pic as a place holder until I come with a better custom icon.


Settings:

For best performance leave as default, shrink the program size and lower the FPS as needed.
Use Stats|Deadline to gauge performance.


On a scale from [0] being negligible/none to [5] being the worst performance cost of settings:

Main|Split Audio - Splits the audio into left(top half) and right(bottom half) channels [4]
Main|Scale - Popup to adjust scaling curves using dragging and scrolling of points [0] 
Main|Curviness - Curves/Smooths the bars with a Savitzky Golay Filter [1] 
Main|Interpolation - By averaging old data with new data it makes the bars appear less noisy [1]
Main|Audio Buffer - Audio frames in the buffer. The higher the number the higher the accuracy, but old data lingers [3]

Design|Color|Bar Color/Background Color/Outline Color - Allows to pick color and alpha(transparency) [0-2]*
Design|Color|Rainbow - Creates a rainbow effect to the colors of Bars/(Outline Only) based on current Bar Color [1]
Design|Gradient - Popup for making a gradient using double left click to make a point and right click to delete a point [0-2]*
Design|Dimensions - Brings up sliders to change the dimensions and look of the bars. [0-5]**
Design|Illuminate - Scales the alpha cap of the bars [2]
Design|Outline Only - If Out Width is more than 0 it will only show the outline. [0]
Design|Cutout - Instead of drawing the bars it will "cut" the background instead [2]

Stats|Deadline - Tells you the percentage of frames that are meeting the frame time(FPS) deadline [0-1]
Stats|Bars - Tells how many bars are being drawn in the window [0-1]
Stats|Latency - Tells the time in ms(milliseconds) from collecting the data to completing a frame [0-1]
Stats|dB Bar - Using a bar it shows you the loudness of the audio in decibels [1]
Stats|Frequencies - Reveals the frequency plots(sample rate / frames) of the bars  [5]
Stats|Notes - Places notes to the closest given frequency plot [4]

* If you change the alpha to anything less than 255 will cost some performance.

**If you change the widths to allow more bars (use Stats|Bars to check) will decrease performance.
  Having (Out)line Width more than 0/enabled will decrease performance.
  And increasing the height to allow the bars to take up more screen space will decrease performance.

Shortcuts:

Scroll - Change Bar height on the fly
Shift - Press once to hide toolbar, Once more to hide the borders and then on more time to bring up the borders and the toolbar again.
Esc - Close program 


Tips:

- Due to timings never being perfect, setting a fps slightly above your refresh rate is a good idea.

- If you like to make the background disappear go into Design|Color|Background Color
and change the alpha channel to 0. Then press SHIFT twice for the borders to go away too.
    - Using this effect on top of a non-Fullscreen YouTube videos is pretty fun.

- Lower the Main|Interpolation and Main|Audio Buffer for more responsiveness, this helps when you have a low FPS set.

- For a Monstercat lite-edition style, set Main|Curviness to Sharp, Main|Audio Buffer to 8192, scale window to have 64 bars(Stats|Bars)
  and keep the rest at default. This WILL NOT look the exact same, that was never my goal to begin with.
